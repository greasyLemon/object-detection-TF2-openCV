# weeds-detection-ML-OpenCV
University science project aims to identify weeds from crops during their early seedling phase. (WIP)
This repository contains the source code and the instructions to build a object detection model that takes in pictures/videos of both weeds and crops together. Our goal is to figure out a method which can safely remove the detected weeds with minimun harm to the crops. <3 <3 <3 <3

**1. Prepare custom dataset.  
  2. Train YOLO/Tensorflow Object Detection Model.  
  3. Convert model to TFLite.  
  4. Run inference (image/webcam/microcontroller).**
